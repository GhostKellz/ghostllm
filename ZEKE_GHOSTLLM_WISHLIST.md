# GhostLLM – GPU-Accelerated AI Proxy 

GhostLLM is a lightweight, high-performance, GPU-accelerated AI proxy and runtime for local, distributed, and blockchain-integrated inference. Built in Zig for low latency, memory safety, and predictable performance.

---

## 🧠 What is GhostLLM?

GhostLLM is your ultra-efficient AI gateway that:

* Hosts models like Claude, GPT, Ollama, vLLM
* Accelerates inference via NVIDIA GPU (CUDA/NVML via FFI)
* Runs QUIC/HTTP3 over IPv6 by default
* Interfaces with GhostChain + ZVM smart contract execution
* Powers agents like `jarvisd`, `jarvis-nv`, and your homegrown workflows

---

## ⚙️ Runtime Modes

* `serve` — QUIC-native LLM serving API
* `bench` — Benchmark GPU inference & latency
* `inspect` — Show GPU stats, model memory, and throughput
* `ghost` — Smart contract-aware inferencing layer for GhostChain/ZVM

---

## 🔧 Features

* ⚡ GPU Acceleration via Zig ↔ CUDA/NVML FFI
* 🔐 Zero-trust architecture for all APIs
* 🌐 HTTP3/QUIC/IPv6 ready by default
* 🧬 Pluggable LLM backend support (via adapters)
* 🔄 Optional async bridge for Rust integrations via `ghostbridge`
* 📦 Container-ready for public LLM node deployments

---

## 📡 Use Cases

* Run Claude or GPT models behind a GPU proxy
* Serve AI agents like `jarvisd` across your homelab
* Accelerate GhostChain node analytics, slashing, remediation
* Replace LiteLLM/OpenWebUI with native Zig GPU control
* Host zero-trust LLM endpoints exposed to Web5 networks

---

## 🔭 Integration Targets

* `ghostchain` → L1 node analytics + smart contract AI hooks
* `zvm` → Contract runtime integrated inference
* `ghostbridge` → Rust ↔ Zig bridge for async LLM calls
* `jarvisd` → AI-powered DevOps / system assistant
* `ghostctl` → CLI interface to control GhostLLM

## 🔮 Vision

GhostLLM becomes the **default Zig-native GPU-aware LLM runtime** across:

* Homelab deployments (Proxmox, Nix, Docker)
* Public ghostchain L1 + ghostplane L2 node infrastructure
* Developer tools like `ghostctl`, `zion`, `jarvisd`
* Edge/mesh networks built on QUIC and ZNS
