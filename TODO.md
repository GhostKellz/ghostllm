## 📝 Notes

- **GPU Support:** Currently excellent NVIDIA support, should extend to AMD/Intel
- **Architecture:** The modular design is solid for scaling to v0.2.0 features
- **Performance:** Current HTTP/1.1 server is basic but functional foundation
- **Documentation:** Need to improve README with actual deployment examples

**Next Immediate Action:** Start with Ollama integration to replace mock responses and make the API actually functional.
